Said, said, said, I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown, 
Oba - obaserving the 'ypocrites
As they would mingle with the good people we meet.
Good friends we have, oh, good friends we've lost
Along the way.
In this great future, you can't forget your past, 
So dry your tears, I seh.
